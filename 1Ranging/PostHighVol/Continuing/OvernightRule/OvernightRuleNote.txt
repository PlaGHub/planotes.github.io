Direction of Tokyo open session:
Applicable to: UJ, AJ, AU and EU

* If  NY session is directional & held on to most of the gains, then
  - Expect price to move in the same direction in first 2 hours of trade (9:00am winter or 11:00 summer)
  - Entry is to fade from the boundary of consolidation range (highside for down direction, and vice versa)

* This scenario is strongest when consolidation  range obey the consolidation rule, 
  i.e., making lower lows and highs for down direction and vice versa
