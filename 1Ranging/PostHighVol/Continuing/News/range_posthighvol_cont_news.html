<ul>
   <li>When news (economic or political) that are genuine (not rumour) surpise, such as the RBNZ decision to cut 50bp instead of 25bp as expected on 7-Aug-2019,or the PBOC allow yuan to devalue substantially on 5-Aug-2019 (01:15 GMT 11:15 AEST), the price action pattern tend to trace out as follow:</li>
       <ul style=display:inline-block; padding-left: 40px;>
           <li>The initial 15M candle at the time of news release form an impulse candle</li>
           <li>The impulse candle should fully engulf the pre-news release range and decisively break SR line</li>
           <li>The impulse candle don't tend to have a long tail.  It should have a short or no wick</li>
           <li>If the above conditions are met, then can expect a follow up 15M candle in the same direction as the impluse candle.</li>
       </ul>
   <li>When news surprise but not in the totally unexpected way (such as PBOC devalue CNY or RBNZ cut bigger than expected) but rather it's follow up news such as PBOC fix USDCNY above 7.0 as has been expected but not as bad as markets has anticipated (fix at 7.0039 instead of 7.02+ on 8-Aug-2019)</li>
       <ul style=display:inline-block; padding-left: 40px;>
           <li>The initial 15M candle at the time of news release form an impulse candle</li>
           <li>The impulse candle is of decent size (20+ pips?) and engulf most but not all of pre-news release range and pausing near SR line</li>
           <li>The impulse candle may have small tail</li>
           <li>but the magnitude of the news is significant enough to sustain another 15M in the same direction</li>
           <li>If the above conditions are met, then can expect a follow up 15M candle in the same direction as the impluse candle that should definitely clear SR line into air pocket</li>
       </ul>
