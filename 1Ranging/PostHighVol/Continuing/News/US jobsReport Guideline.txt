In general,

US job report release early in New York session.  There's the initial kneejerk reaction, but traders
has the entire session to process the data.

Therefore the direction of the entire US session set the trade direction in morning Tokyo session.

But if the session is directionless, or if there was substantial reversal post release, then best to 
stay out of UJ during active phase of Tokyo session.

THE KEY IS TO ENSURE THAT NO IMPORTANT NEWS WERE RELEASE OVER THE WEEKEND AND THEN FADE INTO THE 
DIRECTION OF THE NEW YORK SESSION FOR HIGHER PROB AND TO OPTIMIZE GAIN
