When news surprise but not in the totally unexpected way (such as PBOC devalue CNY or RBNZ cut bigger
than expected) but rather it's follow up news such as PBOC fix USDCNY above 7.0 as has been expected 
but not as bad as markets has anticipated (fix at 7.0039 instead of 7.02+ on 8-Aug-2019).


1. The initial 15M candle at the time of news release form an impulse candle
2. The impulse candle is of decent size (20+ pips?) and engulf most but not all of pre-news release 
   range and pausing near SR line
3. The impulse candle may have small tail
4. but the magnitude of the news is significant enough to sustain another 15M in the same direction
5. If the above conditions are met, then can expect a follow up 15M candle in the same direction as 
   the impluse candle that should definitely clear SR line into air pocket
